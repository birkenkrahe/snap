- Has any of you already programmed?
- Have you ever created an animation or a game?
- Have you created a web page or used a "high level" language like
  Python, C, C++, Java or JavaScript?
- How would you describe the experience of programming?

#+begin_notes
- *COR100/Y1*: Lyon's 1hr/week coursse teasers, fall'23 Snap! 12
  students, weekly meetings of 50 minutes learning Snap!
  together.
- Final team projects: Retro Arcade Games - Donkey Kong, Pacman,
  Space Invaders, and Asteroids.
- Compared to other programming languages, visual, block-based
  languages are very forgiving (computers are extremely picky and
  panic easily) - attention to detail is key

** What is Snap?
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/stemdemo_berkeley.png]]

- Web-based HTML5 online application
- Block-based visual programming language
- Create animations, games, simulations
- Open source and free to use
- [[https://snap.berkeley.edu][Developed at U. Berkeley, bought by SAP]]

#+begin_notes
- <Right-Mouse> View page source (HTML)
- <Right-Mouse> Inspect (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Media)
- Developed by German programmer Jens Moenig
- SAP is Germany's largest software company (ERP systems)
- Unlike MIT's Scratch, Snap! can do anything
- In programming, everything depends on data structures, e.g. numbers,
  strings (that make up texts), tables, lists/dictionaries etc.
- Languages "for anything" allow you to build such structures

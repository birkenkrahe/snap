- Web-based HTML5 online application
- Block-based visual programming language
- Create animations, games, simulations
- Open source and free to use
- [[https://snap.berkeley.edu][Developed at U. Berkeley, bought by SAP]]

#+begin_notes
- <Right-Mouse> View page source (HTML)
- <Right-Mouse> Inspect (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Media)
- Developed by German programmer Jens Moenig
- SAP is Germany's largest software company (ERP systems)
- Unlike MIT's Scratch, Snap! can do anything
- In programming, everything depends on data structures, e.g. numbers,
  strings (that make up texts), tables, lists/dictionaries etc.
- Languages "for anything" allow you to build such structures

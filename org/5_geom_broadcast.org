* XY Geometry and Motion

- [X] Open a new project ~Geometry~
  
- [X] To see the grid, change the background to ~XY-grid~

- Every point on the screen has two coordinates, ~x~ and ~y~

- Every sprite in Snap! has a /center point/ which you can view and
  change in the paint editor

- [X] Open the ~Paint editor~ on the standard turtle sprite

- [X] Turn the turtle into a *solid red square* in the center

- [X] Go to ~Scripts~ and move the sprite to the exact position (0,0)

- [X] Move it to (-200,100)

- [X] Let it ~glide~ in ~2 secs~ to the center position (0,0)

- [X] Add to the last command by changing the ~x~ position by ~-100~

- [X] Add to the last commands and let the square glide ~5~
  times in ~0.5 sec~ between the two positions

- [X] Duplicate the last program and make the square jump up and down
  *smoothly* between the positions (0,0) and (0,10) ten times.

  /Tip: smooth motion is a combo of ~repeat~ and ~change~./

- [X] Add a command to the last program to ~repeat~ the jump ~5~ times -
  this is called a /nested loop/.

* Absolute motion

- Absolute motion is independent on current position and direction

- Example: "Go to the Salty Dog"

- Snap! commands that describe absolute motion:

* Relative motion

- Relative motion depends on current position and direction

- Example: "Turn right then left"

- Snap! commands that describe relative motion:

  [[../img/snap_relative.png]]

* 3-D effect using looping

- Sprite is fully 2-dimensional
- For 3D effects you need to create illusions
- Repetition and size change can do that

- [X] Create a new project and call it ~3dim~
  
- [X] Load the costumes ~dove1 a~ and ~dove1 b~

  [[../img/snap_dove.png]]

- [X] Load any outdoor or indoor background

- [ ] Create and run the following script

  [[../img/snap_3dim.png]]

* Synchronize sprites with broadcasting

- Two sprites are not automatically synchronized
- We can synchronize manually or rely on /broadcasting/
- Broadcasting = sending message to a listener
- This is also the basis of OOP

- Snap! broadcasting commands:

  [[../img/snap_broadcast.png]]

- [ ] Create a new project ~broadcasting~

- [ ] Create two sprites and give each one of these scripts:

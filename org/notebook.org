The Raft of the Medusa, by Theodore Gericault (1818)

Image: "The painting depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck
of the French naval frigate MÃ©duse, which ran aground off the coast of
today's Mauritania on 2 July 1816. On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people
were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in
the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured
starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism." ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raft_of_the_Medusa][Wikipedia]])

- Next: first script

* Week 2: First look at Snap!
** Test 1 available in Canvas (complete by Sept-3)
** Review week 1

- How are programming languages ranked?
  #+begin_quote
  By introducing a suitable metric (measure of greatness), like search
  activity (TIOBE), or customized survey ([[https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/][StackOverflow]], [[https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022][IEEE]]).

  "Thinking about how your workflow and process changes over time, how
  similar or different do you anticipate your workflow to be 1 year
  from now as a result of AI tools you are currently using?"

- How is a [[https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/recording-and-playing-machines/player-piano][player piano]] similar to a computer?
  #+attr_html: :width 400px
  [[../img/player_piano.jpg]]

  #+begin_quote
  The score is an instruction set that is translated into music by the
  piano just like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card][punched card]] for an early computer is translated
  into a program. Content (score, code) is separate from form but "the
  medium is the message" ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message][Marshall McLuhan]]): the artifact carries
  meaning, and it matters in which medium we program machines.
  #+end_quote

- Name parts of the infrastructure that enable Snap! programming.
  #+begin_quote
  #+attr_html: :width 400px

** First Snap! script

- Difference compilation vs. interpretation (REPL).

- "Hello, world" program (aka script) in Python and in Snap!

- Online REPL in replit.com and in snap.berkeley.edu

- Code along now!

* Week 3: Test 1 review / First Snap! program
** Test 1 review

- 35% of you missed the deadline! You can still submit for 50%.

- Let's look at the results of the others:
  #+begin_src R :results graphics output file :file ../data/test1.png
    <<store test results in variable>>
    <<plot histogram of test results>>
    <<plot average of test results>>
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../data/test1.png]]

- Smoothed distribution with customization:
  #+begin_src R :results graphics output file :file ../data/test1cust.png
    test_1 <- c(4.5,8.25,9,8.5,7.25,6.75,8.5,6.25,8.25)
    avg_1 <- mean(test_1)
    avg_pc <- sprintf("%.0f%%", avg_1 * 10)
    plot(density(test_1), lwd=2,
         xlab="Points [max = 10]",
         main="Test 1 Game & Robotics Programming Results")
    abline(v=avg_1,col="red",lwd=2,lty=2)
    text(x=avg_1+0.25,y=0.05,labels=avg_pc,adj=0,col="red")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:../data/test1cust.png]]

- What is a sprint in project management with Scrum?

- What is Git in GitHub?

- Where are the whiteboard photos for this course?

- What's IMRaD about?

- Infrastructure to code at snap.berkeley.edu?
  #+begin_quote
  Yes: network (Internet), operating system (OS), Snap! web app
  (HTML5), web server (HTTPD).

  No: file system for Snap! XML files, command line terminal to
  execute OS commands.
  #+end_quote

- *Test 2 available later today: complete by Sunday, Sept-10.*

** Review last week

Ask yourself if you know the answer as I'm reading the question.

- What does REPL mean and what does it deliver?
  #+begin_quote
  Read-Eval-Print-Loop - refers to the ability of a shell to take
  input from you, evaluate it and print the result without you having
  to do anything. Afterwards, the program awaits further instructions
  (hence the 'loop').
  #+end_quote
- Is Snap! a compiled or an interpreted programming language?
  #+begin_quote
  Strictly speaking, all programming languages must be compiled,
  i.e. source code must be converted to machine code. Interpreted
  languages like R, Python, Snap! conceal this from you by creating
  machine code behind the scenes and then running it for you line by
  line.
  #+end_quote
- Which programming mistakes does a computer tolerate?
  #+begin_quote
  NONE. Computers are programmed in formal languages, which means that
  there is NO margin of error for grammar mistakes (syntax).
  #+end_quote
- Where can you save your Snap! projects?
  #+begin_quote
  In the cloud (snap.berkeley.edu if registered); on a PC as [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/snap/blob/piHome/img/snap_xml.png][XML]] file.
  #+end_quote
- What does the Snap! application offer?
  #+begin_quote
  1) code to move, look, sound, control, sense, draw (& make blocks)
  2) file menu (open/save and import files)
  3) stage with sprites, backgrounds and sounds
  4) sprites with scripts, costumes and sounds
  #+end_quote

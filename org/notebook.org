The Raft of the Medusa, by Theodore Gericault (1818)

Image: "The painting depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck
of the French naval frigate MÃ©duse, which ran aground off the coast of
today's Mauritania on 2 July 1816. On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people
were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in
the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured
starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism." ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raft_of_the_Medusa][Wikipedia]])

#+end_example

** Introduction to Snap! ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/snap/blob/piHome/org/1_introduction.org][GitHub]])

- Snap vs. Scratch
- Snap! interface and examples
- Programming and programming languages
- Importance of infrastructure

- UI/UX (User Interface/User eXperience) as a career
- Next: first script

* DONE Week 2: First look at Snap!
** Test 1 available in Canvas (complete by Sept-3)
** Review week 1

- How are programming languages ranked?
  #+begin_quote
  By introducing a suitable metric (measure of greatness), like search
  activity (TIOBE), or customized survey ([[https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/][StackOverflow]], [[https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022][IEEE]]).

  "Thinking about how your workflow and process changes over time, how
  similar or different do you anticipate your workflow to be 1 year
  from now as a result of AI tools you are currently using?"

- How is a [[https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/recording-and-playing-machines/player-piano][player piano]] similar to a computer?
  #+attr_html: :width 400px
  [[../img/player_piano.jpg]]

  #+begin_quote
  The score is an instruction set that is translated into music by the
  piano just like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card][punched card]] for an early computer is translated
  into a program. Content (score, code) is separate from form but "the
  medium is the message" ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message][Marshall McLuhan]]): the artifact carries
  meaning, and it matters in which medium we program machines.

- What is a sprint in project management with Scrum?

- What is Git in GitHub?

- Where are the whiteboard photos for this course?

- What's IMRaD about?

- Infrastructure to code at snap.berkeley.edu?
  #+begin_quote
  Yes: network (Internet), operating system (OS), Snap! web app
  (HTML5), web server (HTTPD).

  No: file system for Snap! XML files, command line terminal to
  execute OS commands.
  #+end_quote

- *Test 2 available later today: complete by Sunday, Sept-10.*

** Review last week

Ask yourself if you know the answer as I'm reading the question.

- What does REPL mean and what does it deliver?
  #+begin_quote
  Read-Eval-Print-Loop - refers to the ability of a shell to take
  input from you, evaluate it and print the result without you having
  to do anything. Afterwards, the program awaits further instructions
  (hence the 'loop').
  #+end_quote
- Is Snap! a compiled or an interpreted programming language?
  #+begin_quote
  Strictly speaking, all programming languages must be compiled,
  i.e. source code must be converted to machine code. Interpreted
  languages like R, Python, Snap! conceal this from you by creating
  machine code behind the scenes and then running it for you line by
  line.
  #+end_quote
- Which programming mistakes does a computer tolerate?
  #+begin_quote
  NONE. Computers are programmed in formal languages, which means that
  there is NO margin of error for grammar mistakes (syntax).
  #+end_quote
- Where can you save your Snap! projects?
  #+begin_quote
  In the cloud (snap.berkeley.edu if registered); on a PC as [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/snap/blob/piHome/img/snap_xml.png][XML]] file.
  #+end_quote
- What does the Snap! application offer?
  #+begin_quote
  1) code to move, look, sound, control, sense, draw (& make blocks)
  2) file menu (open/save and import files)
  3) stage with sprites, backgrounds and sounds
  4) sprites with scripts, costumes and sounds
  #+end_quote

** First Snap! program
** Summary

- Test 1 grades as histogram with the R language
- Uploading a project to the cloud with notes
- Uploading costumes and background for sprite and stage
- First Snap! script with motion and control commands

* DONE Week 4: Sequence & Sounds
** Vote for Lyon College this week!

** Test 2 results and review

- Test results are much worse (76% completion rate)!? ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/snap/blob/piHome/img/test2cust.png][GitHub]])
  #+attr_html: :width 500px
  [[file:../img/test2cust.png]]

- Tests are OPEN BOOK which means you can and should open Snap! while
  answering questions. 30 minutes more than enough time to try stuff.

- I will open the old tests after the deadline so that you can see
  your mistakes and try again if you wish.

- Test 3 needs to be completed by next week. Almost all questions can
  be checked right away with the Snap! editor.

*** Review

1. A Snap! project is stored on your PC as an XML file.
2. XML files are text files.
3. Computers do NOT tolerate small programming mistakes.
4. Snap! does allow you to upload your own image.
5. Computers convert human-readable source code into machine code.
6. A Snap! script is blocks snapped together.
7. Snap! is a programming language for graphics and animation.
8. You stop a running script by clicking on it again.
9. You can get background images from anywhere (if allowed).
10. Stage and sprites have scripts, sounds, background/costumes.

** Programming assignments

- I will grade your submissions today and give you feedback.
  
- Two more assignments today (until next week).

** Today: Sequence, sounds, start/stop, looping

* DONE Week 5: Jumping, smooth motion, 3D effects
** Fantastic test improvements!

Nothing to complain about here: average result 82%! ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/snap/blob/piHome/img/test1-3.png][GitHub]])
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/test1-3.png]]

** New test and new assignment coming today

I will grade your previous assignments by next week.

You can complete all assignments late for 50% of the points.

** Today: jumping up and down, smooth motion, 3D-effects

Covering chapters 4-5 in your textbook and in my script (see GitHub).

* DONE Week 6 + 7: Broadcasting and story animation project
* DONE Week 8: Fall break
* DONE Week 9: Spragins House lunch/Events & concurrency
* DONE Week 10: Keyboard interaction
[[../img/class.png]]

** Concern about grades [posted]

A few of you have come forward with concerns about your grades (in
this class). Most of you are in good shape - but a few of you are
toying with fate.

To improve your grade:
- In the remaining tests, work through the questions using Snap! (Why
  would anyone not have 10 points who followed that advice? 
- I gave you 100% participation already because everyone's
  engaged. I'll reduce that grade accordingly if someone's very
  severely slacking.
- We'll start the programming exercises in class so that you have
  something to work with and you can finish and submit them later.
- The H.A.T.S. grade is 25% of your total grade: participate actively
  in the challenge and you'll be OK.
- For the remaining 4 tests, not your first but your best grade will
  be retained. This means that you can redo a test until you get 100%
  (however, there's a waiting period between tests and you won't get
  the correct answers).

** Events and concurrency
  
Welcome back after three weeks of no-code or low-code!

After our story animation, I asked you to work through the topics
"events" and "concurrency" on your own (pp. 53-63 in the textbook).

Events and concurrency example: [[https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?username=birkenkrahe&projectname=Ball][rolling ball]] - two events triggered by
the green flag:
1) glide to right end of the screen then wrap around
2) turn 4 degrees at one time forever

The [[https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?username=birkenkrahe&projectname=Bird][bird]] has even more events:
1) wait and turn
2) change costume and bounce off edge
3) change color
4) change size
5) change whirl effect
6) play sound every 5 seconds

** Today: keyboard input (towards "Helicopter")

[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/snap/blob/piHome/org/8_keyboard.org][Script in GitHub as always.]]

* DONE Week 11: Project helicopter [H.A.T.S.]

- In the first part of the session, we'll build a minimal helicopter.
- You can upload your finished file for 10 points [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2031/assignments/16834][in Canvas]].
- Improvements to the helicopter: upload new version for bonus points!
- We'll look at the best results in class next week.
- In 2nd part of the session, discuss H.A.T.S. poster / presentation.

* Week 12: Introducing Python

- We're skipping "mouse control" and "making blocks" (GitHub).
- Making blocks means that you can make your own functions.
- [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2031/assignments/16835][3-level maze game instructions]] (bonus assignment)
- Introduction to Python and ="hello, world"= in Snap! and Python
- Introduction to Google Colaboratory (~colab.research.google.com~)
- Optional: look at "Ball and paddle" in Python using ~replit.com~
- Home assignment: explore the ~microbit~ - the brain of the Finch
  
* Week 13: Programming the Finch 2.0: Motion
* Week 14: Programming the Finch 2.0: Lights and sensors
* Week 15: Programming the Finch 2.0: parade project
* H.A.T.S. presentation (Nov 30)

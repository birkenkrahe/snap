Agenda overview - what I had planned and what we achieved in each
session of the course.

finished in the subsequent session(s) without change of the

Your first assignment is to read the introduction and chapter 1.1
("First Look at Snap!") in the textbook that you received in class
(p.11-20).

You do not have to work through this: we will take our time with it -
just give it a quick look over a bowl of rice or cereal. It will be
easier for you to follow if you have already seen the material, and
perhaps you're intrigued and want to read on or register at
snap.berkeley.edu already and try some of these commands.  If not, no
harm done - we'll do this in class together, without rush or blush.

* Scots  (Aug-14)   - Win the Rafting Race

#+begin_notes
Image: "The painting depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck
of the French naval frigate Méduse, which ran aground off the coast of
today's Mauritania on 2 July 1816. On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people
were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in
the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured
starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism." ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raft_of_the_Medusa][Wikipedia]])

** MS Office 365 @Lyon

#+begin_quote
Prof. Miller: "Today in one of my upper division classes, I was
talking to students about MS Office and found that at least a few
didn't know they had *access to the MS Office suite* through their Lyon
accounts. It occured to me that this would probably be a good thing to
mention to our Y1 students in class. IT has a good guide for
installing MS Office [[[https://www.lyon.edu/IT-FAQ][in the IT FAQ]]] that you could share with your
students."

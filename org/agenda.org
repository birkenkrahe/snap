of the French naval frigate Méduse, which ran aground off the coast of
today's Mauritania on 2 July 1816. On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people
were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in
the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured
starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism." ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raft_of_the_Medusa][Wikipedia]])

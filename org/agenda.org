Agenda overview - what I had planned and what we achieved in each

finished in the subsequent session(s) without change of the
originally date.

Image: "The painting depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck
of the French naval frigate MÃ©duse, which ran aground off the coast of
today's Mauritania on 2 July 1816. On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people
were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in
the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured
starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism." ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raft_of_the_Medusa][Wikipedia]])

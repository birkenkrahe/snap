Agenda overview - what I had planned and what we achieved in each

Your first assignment is to read the introduction and chapter 1.1
("First Look at Snap!") in the textbook that you received in class
(p.11-20).

You do not have to work through this: we will take our time with it -
just give it a quick look over a bowl of rice or cereal. It will be
easier for you to follow if you have already seen the material, and
perhaps you're intrigued and want to read on or register at
snap.berkeley.edu already and try some of these commands.Â  If not, no
harm done - we'll do this in class together, without rush or blush.

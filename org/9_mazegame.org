* Objective
We're going to code a game of maze together - you can
then refine and finish the game on your own at will.

Upload the finished game to the Snap! cloud and upload the URL as
usual to Canvas for practice points.

* Step 1: setup

[[../img/s_maze_setup.png]]

1) Download the sprite, background and sounds as a ZIP file:
   [[https://tinyurl.com/5n8xke8z][tinyurl.com/5n8xke8z]]

2) Extract the file on your PC

3) Create new Snap! project and save it as ~mazegame~
   
4) Set up /sprite/, /backgrounds/ and /sounds/:
   - Set up (draggable) sprite ~player~
   - Set up sprite sounds for ~buzzer~ (wall), ~clap~ (level up)
   - Set up stage sound for winning the game (~yea~)
   - Set up stage backgrounds: three levels and final screen

* Step 2: sprite script

1) Open the ~player~ script editor

2) Make a new ~Motion~ block and call it ~MovePlayer~

3) Make a start script (green flag) that moves the ~player~ back to the
   starting position (x = -218, y = 160)

4) Set up keyboard actions for arrows

5) Modify the ~MovePlayer~ block

   [[../img/s_maze_move.png]]

* Step 3: stage script

1) When game starts, switch to ~level1~
   #+attr_html: :width 200px
   [[../img/s_maze_level1.png]]

2) When ~next-level~ broadcast is received, change costume and play
   winning sound when all levels are finished

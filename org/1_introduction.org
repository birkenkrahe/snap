* INTRODUCTION
* Snap! vs. Scratch

- Web-based online application (HTML5), no desktop app

- Comparison between Snap! and Scratch ([[https://snap.berkeley.edu/about][About Snap!]]):
  + Snap! allows the user to define *data structures* like trees, heaps,
    hash tables etc. because you can define a "list of lists".
  + In Snap!, you can also create *control structures* like functions
    that allow you to automate things.
  + Data and control structures are the backbone of any form of
    *imperative* computer programming.

* Programming

- This could be your first ever programming course. Is it?

  #+begin_quote Survey
  + What were your other courses about?
  + What did you take away from them?
  + What's your view towards programming?

- Why should you bother to learn how to program?

  #+begin_quote Answer:
  + Understand the relationships of humans and machines[fn:1]
  + Develop critical thinking skills[fn:2]
  + Create games and animations[fn:3]

- The diagram shows different relevant levels of programming and
  computing including hardware (bottom half) and software (top
  half). In this course, we're working on /"Applications"/ that use the
  computer to solve problems. Languages other than /Snap!/ on this level
  include /C++/, /Java/, and /Python/ (all of these are OOP languages[fn:4]).

- The top level "Users" refers to most people who only use computers
  (mostly when operating their smart phones, or driving their
  cars). As with phones or cars, most of the power is under the hood.

- I recommend maintaining a (digital) notebook for this course. That's
  exactly what I did when working through the textbook, using the [[https://orgmode.org/][GNU
  Emacs editor with Org-mode]].
* Why Snap!

- It's a full-fledged programming language
- It's easy to build animation and games in it
- It's instantly, freely available online
- It trains pseudocode and modular design
- It's suited for data science applications
- I've always wanted to get into it
* UNIT 1: LOOPING, BROADCASTING, ANIMATION
* Concepts

- [X] Snap user interface (UI)
- [ ] Paint editor
- [ ] Sequence of commands
- [ ] Motion commands
- [ ] Simple looping (repeat, forever)
- [ ] Absolute motion
- [ ] Relative motion
- [ ] Smooth motion using repeat
- [ ] Nested looping
- [ ] XY geometry
- [ ] Costume-based animation
* FIRST LOOK AT SNAP!
* What is a User Interface?

- A /user interface/ (UI) is the dashboard or platform that allows a
  user to interact with an application. It's the first thing that you,
  as a user, see.

- UI/UX is an important, relatively new, interdisciplinary field that
  includes art and design, usability analysis, etc. UX focuses on the
  user's path to solving a problem (like shopping online), while UI
  focuses on the look of the surface of an interactive product (like a
  web site for online shopping). More: [[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-user-reseach-to-create-the-perfect-ui-design/][freecodecamp.org video course]].
* Snap! user interface

- Connect to /snap.berkeley.edu/ and register using your name and Lyon
  student email address.

- For offline use - on any computer that you can administer,
  i.e. where you can download and install programs as you please -
  download the [[https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap/releases/tag/v7.3.1][source files from GitHub]], unpack the files, and open
  ~snap.html~ in a browser.

- This is how the interface looks like:

- The interface is reminiscent of a movie maker's studio: /commands/ are
  assembled in the /script/ area, and the resulting action plays out on
  a /stage/ with a cast of characters called /sprites/. Every sprite has a
  script associated with it.

- Compare with Windows Movie Maker - commands on the left, script in
  the lower half of the screen, sprites/characters in the middle, and
  stage on the right hand side.

- As a programmer, you are writing the script for each sprite,
  including movements, sounds, and costumes, but you are also the
  producer, casting director, and editor.

- Web-based online application (HTML5), no desktop app though you can
  (and should) download it from here:
  1) In your browser, go to [[https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap/releases/][github.com/jmoenig/Snap/releases]]
  2) Click on "Source code (zip)" for instant download
  3) In your browser (or on your PC) navigate to ~Downloads~
  4) ~Extract all~ files to any location (~Downloads~ is OK)
  5) Go to the Snap directory, open it and click on ~snap.html~ to start
  6) Close the editor again, and enter ~Snap~ in the Windows search bar
  7) Pin the Snap! app to the taskbar for later use.

- Comparison between Snap! and Scratch ([[https://snap.berkeley.edu/about][About Snap!]]):
  + Snap! allows the user to define *data structures* like trees, heaps,
    hash tables etc. because you can define a "list of lists".
  + In Snap!, you can also create *control structures* like functions
    that allow you to automate things.
  + Data and control structures are the backbone of any form of
    *imperative* computer programming.

- This enables you to do things you cannot do in Scratch, including
  anything other high-level languages like C++ or Python can do

You can program the Sphero Bolt robot with Scratch ([[https://sphero.com/blogs/news/sphero-edu-implements-scratch][see here]]) or
with Python (we'll do that).

** Computing vs. programming
#+attr_html: :width 700px
[[../img/1_steinhart.png]]

#+begin_notes
- The diagram shows different relevant levels of programming and
  computing including hardware (bottom half) and software (top
  half). In this course, we're working on /"Applications"/ that use the
  computer to solve problems. Languages other than /Snap!/ on this level
  include /C++/, /Java/, and /Python/ (all of these are OOP languages

- The top level "Users" refers to most people who only use computers
  (mostly when operating their smart phones, or driving their
  cars). As with phones or cars, most of the power is under the hood.

- I recommend maintaining a (digital) notebook for this course. That's
  exactly what I did when working through the textbook, using
  [[https://orgmode.org/][Emacs]]. (Talk to me if you want to know more about Emacs.)

* The Importance of Infrastructure
#+attr_html: :width 700px
[[../img/0_nesting.jpg]]

#+begin_notes
Some infrastructure that separates you from just "getting on" with it:

1. Network server / network
2. Keyboard / Screen
3. Operating system (OS)
4. OS shell / terminal / console
5. Python shell / console
6. File system
7. Compiler/interpreter
8. Editor
9. Middleware and meta data
10. Graphical user interface

(Most of these infrastructure components are written in C/C++.)

In Snap!, most of these elements (but not all) are hidden from you.

* Why Snap!
#+attr_html: :width 700px
[[../img/stemdemo_arcade.png]]

#+begin_notes
*Why Snap!*
- It's a full-fledged programming language
- It's easy to build animation and games in it
- It's instantly, freely available online
- It trains pseudocode and modular design
- It's suited for data science applications (muldidim arrays)
- It allows you to define recursive functions ([[https://youtu.be/4Cyer8NwMXw][see here]])
- I've always wanted to get into it
#+end_notes
* Why not just Python?
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/python.png]]
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/snapref.png]]

#+begin_notes

*But why not just Python?*
- My intuition (better for beginners and tourists)
- Much, much steeper learning curve to get to game design
- Snotty developer community (arrogant nerds aren't nice)
- Compare Python reference vs. Snap! reference manual:

* What is a User Interface?
#+attr_html: :width 700px
[[../img/ui.jpg]]

#+begin_notes
- A /user interface/ (UI) is the dashboard or platform that allows a
  user to interact with an application. It's the first thing that you,
  as a user, see.

- UI/UX is an important, relatively new, interdisciplinary field that
  includes art and design, usability analysis, etc. UX focuses on the
  user's path to solving a problem (like shopping online), while UI
  focuses on the look of the surface of an interactive product (like a
  web site for online shopping). More: [[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-user-reseach-to-create-the-perfect-ui-design/][freecodecamp.org video course]].

** Snap! user interface
#+attr_html: :width 700px
[[../img/snap.png]]

#+begin_notes

- Connect to /snap.berkeley.edu/ and register using your name and Lyon
  student email address.

- For offline use - on any computer that you can administer,
  i.e. where you can download and install programs as you please -
  download the [[https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap/releases/tag/v7.3.1][source files from GitHub]], unpack the files, and open
  ~snap.html~ in a browser.
#+end_notes

** Snap interface
#+attr_html: :width 700px
[[../img/snap_ui.png]]

#+begin_notes
- The interface is reminiscent of a movie maker's studio: /commands/ are
  assembled in the /script/ area, and the resulting action plays out on
  a /stage/ with a cast of characters called /sprites/. Every sprite has a
  script associated with it.

#+end_notes
** Windows Movie Maker
#+attr_html: :width 700px
[[../img/snap_moviemaker.jpg]]

#+begin_notes
- Compare with Windows Movie Maker - commands on the left, script in
  the lower half of the screen, sprites/characters in the middle, and
  stage on the right hand side.
- As a programmer, you are writing the script for each sprite,
  including movements, sounds, and costumes, but you are also the
  producer, casting director, and editor.
#+end_notes

* Summary
#+begin_example
- Berkeley's Snap! is a development of MIT's Scratch, created in HTML5
  (with JavaScript), available online or on your PC for download.

- In Snap!, you can define multidimensional arrays and recursive
  functions, which means that you can do anything a high-level
  language like Python can do, too.

- Programming can help you understand machines, your own thinking, and
  you can build applications for humans (like games and animations).

- Programming languages are like natural languages, only much stricter.

- Many layers of computing infrastructure separate you from just
  "getting on with it" - in Snap! you won't have to know most of them.

- A user interface allows a user to interact with an
  application. UI/UX design is an important, growing career field.

#+end_example
* Next: looping, broadcasting, animation

- Snap user interface (UI)
- Paint editor
- Sequence of commands
- Motion commands
- Simple looping (repeat, forever)
- Absolute motion
- Relative motion
- Smooth motion using repeat
- Nested looping
- XY geometry

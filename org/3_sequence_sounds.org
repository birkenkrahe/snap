* Sequences

- The word /sequence/ comes from the Latin word /sequi/, "to follow".

- Computers require /exact/ sequences of steps or statements to
  work - like a /to do/ list:
  1. Rise and wake puppy.
  2. Feed puppy.
  3. Walk puppy.

- /Deviations/ from the prescribed sequence lead to errors.

- The worst errors are those that remain /undiscovered/: the script will
  run but it won't do what we expect it to do, and /debugging/ is hard.

- A script like [[sequence]] below represents a series of steps.

* *Practice* - Sequences

1) Define a new project "Sequence" and build this script
   in your Snap! dashboard. You can pick a non-standard sprite if you
   like.

2) When you try to run the script a second time, nothing happens. What
   could you do to re-run it properly? - /Tip: check "Looks" commands./

   #+begin_notes
   Add the ~Looks::show~ command at the top.
   #+end_notes

4) Make the change and re-run the script.

5) Save the [[https://snap.berkeley.edu/project?user=birkenkrahe&project=Sequence][Sequence]] project to the cloud and find it in *My Projects*.

* Sounds

- Every sprite has a ~Sounds~ tab

- You can /import/ an existing sound from the Snap! library (~Sounds~
  option in the main menu), or you can /upload/ your own sound (mp3).

- The ~play sound ... until done~ command moves do the next statement
  only if the sound file has been played.

  #+caption: Play sound ... until done
  [[../img/snap_play.png]]

- The ~play sound...~ command starts playing the sound file and moves
  immediately on to the next statement.

  #+caption: Play sound ...
  [[../img/snap_play1.png]]

- You can stop all sounds with the ~stop all sounds~ command.

* *Practice* - Sounds

1) Define a new project "SoundCheck".
2) Pick a costume and a suitable sound.
3) Write a script that produces 5 consecutive sounds *without loop*.
4) ~Duplicate~ the script and add a ~repeat~ loop with only one sound
   command
5) Save the project to your ~My Projects~ list

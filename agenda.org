** Hello, Linux

- [X] Short recap
- [X] C Toolchain practice

*** Short recap

- What (if anything) do you remember from the last session?
- What was important to you?
- What did you not understand?
- What would you like to hear more about?

1) David/Boogie: The Linux guy Linus Torvalds developed both the
   Linux kernel and the version control system 'Git' (as in
   GitHub).

2) Michael: the "kernel" (pronounced "colonel") is the nucleus or
   heart of the operating system (OS).

   3) Rhett: computers depend on "daemons" (e.g. systemd) that wait in
      the background until called upon; you cannot talk to them directly

      4) Keidrick: C code performs very well (it's fast)

      5) Alexandrea: (human-readable) C source code has to be compiled
         into machine code to be executable (binary)

*** GitHub

The GitHub hello world exercise: [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#completing-the-github-hello-world-exercise][see FAQ]] - this will teach you the
basics of the GitHub process, important for software development.

1) ~./~ stands for the current directory (~$PWD~)
2) There are usually many options to get the computer to do one and
   the same thing - they differ by convenience, speed,...
3) You can use ~wget~ to download files from the web using only the
   URL (the Uniform Resource Locator)
4) The ~ls~ command lists files (and directories)
5) Climbing around the file tree with ~cd ..~ (to get one directory
   up from ~$PWD~.

  #+begin_quote
  "It's important to understand the evolution of the technology that
  we use and take for granted The decisions that shaped how that
  technology developed and thus defined the paths that we took were
  made by real people, working under the pressures and constraints
  of time. The more we know about the history, the more we can
  appreciate the inventive genius that led to Unix and perhaps
  better understand why modern computer systems are as they are. If
  nothing else, choices that might seem wrong-headed or perverse
  today can often be seen as natural consequences of what was
  understood and could be accomplished with the resources available
  at the time." - Brian Kernighan (2019)

- [X] Pi @ home: *"If you break it, you buy it."*
  #+begin_quote
  If you break the Pi 400 computer (pour coffee over it, or damage it
  in any way that makes it unusable), you must replace it (for [[https://www.amazon.com/seeed-studio-Raspberry-Personal-Computer/dp/B08T6KSF7F/][$100]]).

*** DONE George PÃ³lya: "How to solve it"

#+attr_html: :width 200px
#+caption: How To Solve It by George PÃ³lya (1945)
[[./img/polya.jpg]]

1) Understand the problem
2) Devise a plan
3) Carry out the plan
4) Review and/or extend solution

Further study:
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It][Wikipedia: How To Solve It]]
- [[https://youtu.be/zhL3EMFSm6o][YouTube: Illustration]] (2018)
- [[https://youtu.be/h0gbw-Ur_do][YouTube: PÃ³lya explains the problem solving technique]] (1966)

** Recap: programming assignment
*** How did you approach this problem?

1. Figure out the math first (if in trouble, find a common or simpler
   example)
2. Identify constants (speed of light)
3. Identify variables (height)
4. Identify input and output
5. Identify possible extensions
6. Create an Org-mode file that will contain the solution
7. Inside the file create a code block
8. Begin to code: declare variables
9. Initialize variables
10. Compute output
11. Print output
12. Debugging

*** Questions

- What is 1 light-year in meters?
- What is the conversion factor for meters to light-years?

*** Minimal solution

#+name: pgm2:solution
#+begin_src C
  float c = 299792458;
  float y =  31536000;
  float height  = 1.8f;
  float ly = c * y;

  printf("%.1f m = %e light-years\n", height, height / ly );
#+end_src

** Reading input exercise

1) Create an Org-mode file ~input.org~
2) Add this header at the top of the file and activate it with ~C-c C-c~

   #+name: header
   #+begin_example
     #+STARTUP: overview hideblocks indent
     #+PROPERTY: header-args:C :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
   #+end_example

3) Enter the code in the code block:

   #+name: input
   #+begin_src C :tangle input.c :results output
     // declare integer
     int i;
     // ask for input
     printf("Enter an integer number: ");
     // get input
     scanf("%d", &i);
     // print input
     printf("You entered: %d\n", i);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS: input
   : Enter an integer number: You entered: 10301340

4) Run the code inside Emacs - this does not work!
5) Tangle the code (~C-c C-v t~).
6) Open a shell in another buffer window (~M-x shell~).
7) Compile and run the program ~input.c~ on the shell.
8) Go back to the Org-file ~input.org~ and add a ~bash~ code block:

   #+name: bash
   #+begin_src bash :results silent
     echo "100" > ./marcus
   #+end_src

   This block puts the number 15 into the file ~input~.

9) Now go back to your C code block and add the header argument
   ~:cmdline < input~ to it.

10) Run the C code block again. It should now give the correct result
    and print out ~15~. You can try this with other numbers that you
    enter in the bash code block:

    #+name: input1
    #+begin_src C :results output :cmdline < marcus
      // declare integer
      int i;
      // ask for input
      printf("Enter an integer number: ");
      // get input
      scanf("%d", &i);
      // print input
      printf("You entered: %d\n", i);
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS: input1
    : Enter an integer number: You entered: 100

*** Steve Yegge: "Should you get a CS degree or can you teach yourself?"

#+attr_html: :width 400px
#+caption: Stevey's Tech Talk E42 (27 March 2022)
[[./img/yegge.png]]

- Introducing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Yegge][Steve Yegge]] - stellar software developer

- Stevey's Tech Talk E42: [[https://youtu.be/Q4Y6ERYAwqw][Should I get a CS degree or can I teach myself?]]

- Powerful learning advice, book and interviewing advice[fn:6]:

  1) If you want something badly enough, you're going to get it!

  2) You can teach yourself CS but you'll have to be very disciplined

  3) The 100-300 level basics: discrete maths, theory of
     computation, data structures, algorithms, stats, linear
     algebra.

  4) Most important: being able to identify the problem when it
     comes at you - this will usually be tested in interviews.

  5) Learn multiple programming languages (from different camps):
     e.g. C/C++, Lisp (with Emacs!), R (statistical), SQL
     (databases)

  6) 400 level courses: operating systems (OS) (Linux!), and
     compilers - focus on *efficiency*. There should be no layer of
     "magic" for you when it comes to resource management. Include:
     *machine learning* and *data science*.

  7) Computer science in particular, and college in general teaches
     you to teach yourself.

  8) Force yourself to like stuff that you don't want to
     learn. Especially if you're cramming (doing it too late).

** Bonus content
*** Dunning-Kruger effect and hype cycle

This curve is well-known in business technology where it is used to
describe the evolution of innovative technologies (the so-called "hype
cycle" - [[https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-08-23-gartner-identifies-key-emerging-technologies-spurring-innovation-through-trust-growth-and-change][Gartner 2021]]).

It is also used to describe the evolution of confidence when learning
something for the first time (like programming). Timely, as you're
probably heading for "Mount Stupid".

In fact, the curve looks suspiciously like a driven dampened, harmonic
oscillator known in physics (a model that describes, e.g. the motion
of a spring.

 * Footnotes
[fn:7]"Bonus content" is content that I have sampled and that I
present to you as is. Usually these are podcasts or videos, or
articles that I found interesting and that you might also enjoy.

[fn:1]Popular languages include: C++ (industry), C# (games), Java
(enterprise), Python (machine learning), PHP (web dev),
JavaScript (web dev), etc.

[fn:2]Another language that is popular in space is Lisp - see this
2022 podcast on robots and Mars missions, "LISP in space" -
incidentally, Lisp is what powers our IDE, GNU Emacs.

[fn:3]The /kernel/ is the core of an operating system, the software that
brings your computer to life. Kernel tasks include: booting (starting
up), managing processes, performance, and guarding the computer.

[fn:4]Mentioned are: memory allocation and management. C achieves this
e.g. by its use of /pointers/ which we will encounter in this course,
though more technical memory management techniques are out of our
reach.

[fn:5]Org-mode file (you can complete this at the end of class or at
home if you take the Pi home; or you could [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-can-i-install-emacs-as-a-data-science-ide-on-windows-10][install Emacs]] and [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#how-to-install-gcc--a-c-compiler-under-windows-and-macos][install
GCC]] on your Windows laptop, see [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][FAQ in GitHub]]).

[fn:6]What if you don't want to become a software engineer or computer
scientist? Answer: doesn't matter because the ideas and demands of
computer craft are, by now, ubiquitous and relevant to (almost) any
job. This is because the success of machines has convinced most
people, alas, that it's efficient to apply machine rules to
everything. We know much more about machines now than about humans.
